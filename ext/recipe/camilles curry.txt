First thing : I never know quantities. I cook to taste. So you can adjust all ingredients as you go, to your taste.
To start you'll need onion, garlic, shallots and ginger

Dice everything really finely, and start cooking it in a pot or a a deep frying pan
(In olive oil or sunflower oil)

Then add some thyme (maybe a table spoon) and curry powder (maybe 3 or 4 table spoons)

Once that mix is soft and golden, add some dice chicken (I used breast today but any piece would do)

When the chicken is starts to get some colors (while still being pink inside), you can add some diced tomatoes. Grandma add some in the feeezer she made last summer from the garden but the canned ones can work if you can't bother to make your own.

Let it reduce a bit, all in the pot, then add some coconut cream (a good amount, maybe 1 can for 2 people)

You can then add 2 or 3 beans of vanilla, cut open (from madagascar if you find some, it's the best in the world). And a few cardamom pods, cut in half.

While it cooks slowly (medium heat, cover your pot), you can starts making the cold side condiments
Dice some fresh tomatoes, zest some lime, add lime juice, and green onions and shallots in one bowl

In another bowl, fine slices of green mango, grated fresh ginger, lime juice and chilli flakes or fresh red hot chilli sliced finely

Boom voila!

Then come back to your pot, stir, add some chilli (here I used green chilli crushed with kaffir lime, straight from Madagascar)


Add some lime juice (half one or more) + a teaspoon of brown sugar (or more), + salt and pepper. Taste it, adjust.


Cook some brown rice on the side. Crush some cashew nuts and cut some fresh coriander leaves


Then when you are happy with the taste, you can serve
